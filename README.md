# Experiment 2

## Aim
To study and implement the structure of a C++ program focusing on data types.

## Theory

The structure of a C++ program includes preprocessor directives, the main function, and various statements and expressions. Data types in C++ specify the type of data that a variable can hold. Basic data types include `int` for integers, `float` and `double` for floating-point numbers, `char` for characters, and `bool` for boolean values. Derived data types include arrays, pointers, and references, while user-defined data types include structs, classes, and enums. Understanding and correctly using data types is essential for effective programming, as they determine the operations that can be performed on the data and how the data is stored in memory.

## Code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
     int a1;
     float a2;
      char a3;
      short int a4;
      long int a5;
      double a6;
    

    std::cout << "Size of a1: " << sizeof(a1) << "byte"<< std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of a2: " << sizeof(a2) << "byte"<< std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of a3: " << sizeof(a3) << "byte"<< std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of a4: " << sizeof(a4) << "byte"<< std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of a5: " << sizeof(a5) << "byte"<< std::endl;
    std::cout << "Size of a6: " << sizeof(a6) << "byte"<< std::endl;
    
    return 0;
/*Size of a1: 4byte
Size of a2: 4byte
Size of a3: 1byte
Size of a4: 2byte
Size of a5: 8byte
Size of a6: 8byte
*/
}

Understanding and implementing different data types is crucial for effective programming in C++. This experiment provided hands-on experience with basic data types in C++ and demonstrated their usage within a simple program.



# Experiment 3

## Aim

## Theory

### Operators in C++
Operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. C++ provides a rich set of operators classified into several categories:

#### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - **Addition (`+`)**
   - **Subtraction (`-`)** 
   - **Multiplication (`*`)**
   - **Division (`/`)**
   - **Modulus (`%`)** 

#### 2. **Relational Operators**:
   - **Equal to (`==`)**
   - **Not equal to (`!=`)**
   - **Greater than (`>`)** 
   - **Less than (`<`)** 
   - **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)** 
   - **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**

#### 3. **Logical Operators**:
   - **Logical AND (`&&`)** 
   - **Logical OR (`||`)** 
   - **Logical NOT (`!`)** 

#### 4. **Assignment Operators**:
   - **Assignment (`=`)**
   - **Add and assign (`+=`)**
   - **Subtract and assign (`-=`)**
   - **Multiply and assign (`*=`)** 
   - **Divide and assign (`/=`)**
   - **Modulus and assign (`%=`)**

#### 5. **Increment and Decrement Operators**:
   - **Increment (`++`)**
   - **Decrement (`--`)**

#### 6. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**:
   - **Conditional (`?:`)**: Returns one of two values depending on the result of a condition.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a,b,c,add,sub,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7;
    int div,prod,mod;

    cout<<"Enter the value for A"<<endl;
    cin>>a;

Understanding and correctly implementing these operators is essential for performing different types of operations and controlling the flow of a C++ program. This experiment provided practical knowledge of how these operators work and their applications in a program.



# Experiment 4

## Aim
To study and implement C++ bitwise operators.

## Theory

Bitwise operators in C++ operate on the binary representation of integers. They include the bitwise AND (`&`), which returns a bit set to 1 if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1; the bitwise OR (`|`), which returns a bit set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1; the bitwise XOR (`^`), which returns a bit set to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1; the bitwise NOT (`~`), which inverts all bits of the operand; the left shift (`<<`), which shifts bits to the left and fills with zeros; and the right shift (`>>`), which shifts bits to the right. These operators are used for low-level programming tasks, such as setting, clearing, and toggling specific bits, and for performing fast arithmetic operations. Understanding bitwise operators is essential for tasks that require direct manipulation of data at the bit level, such as system programming, graphics, and encryption.

## Code
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a,b,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6;

    cout<<"Enter the value for A"<<endl;
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"Enter the value for B"<<endl;
    cin>>b;
    a1=a&b;    //------BITWISE OPERATOR
    a2=a|b;    //------BITWISE OPERATOR
    a3=a^b;    //------BITWISE OPERATOR
    a4=~b;     //------BITWISE OPERATOR
    a5=a<<2;   //------BITWISE OPERATOR
    a6=a>>2;   //------BITWISE OPERATOR

    cout<<"AND of the entered value is "<<a1<<endl<<endl;
    cout<<"OR of the entered value is "<<a2<<endl<<endl;
    cout<<"XOR of the entered value is "<<a3<<endl<<endl;
    cout<<"NOT of B is "<<a4<<endl<<endl;
    cout<<"LEFT SHIFT of A by 2 is "<<a5<<endl<<endl;
    cout<<"RIGHT SHIFT of A by 2 is "<<a6<<endl<<endl;

    return 0;
/*Enter the value for A
1
Enter the value for B
0
AND of the entered value is 0

OR of the entered value is 1

XOR of the entered value is 1

NOT of B is -1

LEFT SHIFT of A by 2 is 4

RIGHT SHIFT of A by 2 is 0
*/
}

## Conclusion
Bitwise operators in C++ provide powerful tools for manipulating individual bits of data. They are used in a variety of low-level programming tasks and can greatly optimize certain types of operations. Understanding and implementing these operators is crucial for efficient and effective programming in system-level applications and performance-critical code. This experiment provided an in-depth understanding of how bitwise operators work and their practical applications.
