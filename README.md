# Experiment 2

## Aim
To study and implement the structure of a C++ program focusing on data types.

## Theory

The structure of a C++ program includes preprocessor directives, the main function, and various statements and expressions. Data types in C++ specify the type of data that a variable can hold. Basic data types include `int` for integers, `float` and `double` for floating-point numbers, `char` for characters, and `bool` for boolean values. Derived data types include arrays, pointers, and references, while user-defined data types include structs, classes, and enums. Understanding and correctly using data types is essential for effective programming, as they determine the operations that can be performed on the data and how the data is stored in memory.

## Conclusion
The structure of a C++ program includes preprocessor directives, namespace declarations, the main function, and various statements and expressions. Understanding and implementing different data types is crucial for effective programming in C++. This experiment provided hands-on experience with basic data types in C++ and demonstrated their usage within a simple program.



# Experiment 3

## Aim
To study and implement various operators in C++.

## Theory

### Operators in C++
Operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. C++ provides a rich set of operators classified into several categories:

#### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - **Addition (`+`)**
   - **Subtraction (`-`)** 
   - **Multiplication (`*`)**
   - **Division (`/`)**
   - **Modulus (`%`)** 

#### 2. **Relational Operators**:
   - **Equal to (`==`)**
   - **Not equal to (`!=`)**
   - **Greater than (`>`)** 
   - **Less than (`<`)** 
   - **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)** 
   - **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**

#### 3. **Logical Operators**:
   - **Logical AND (`&&`)** 
   - **Logical OR (`||`)** 
   - **Logical NOT (`!`)** 

#### 4. **Assignment Operators**:
   - **Assignment (`=`)**
   - **Add and assign (`+=`)**
   - **Subtract and assign (`-=`)**
   - **Multiply and assign (`*=`)** 
   - **Divide and assign (`/=`)**
   - **Modulus and assign (`%=`)**

#### 5. **Increment and Decrement Operators**:
   - **Increment (`++`)**
   - **Decrement (`--`)**

#### 6. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**:
   - **Conditional (`?:`)**: Returns one of two values depending on the result of a condition.

## Conclusion
The experiment covered various operators in C++, including arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, increment/decrement, and the conditional operator. Understanding and correctly implementing these operators is essential for performing different types of operations and controlling the flow of a C++ program. This experiment provided practical knowledge of how these operators work and their applications in a program.



# Experiment 4

## Aim
To study and implement C++ bitwise operators.

## Theory
### Experiment 4

## Aim
To study and implement C++ bitwise operators.

## Theory

Bitwise operators in C++ operate on the binary representation of integers. They include the bitwise AND (`&`), which returns a bit set to 1 if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1; the bitwise OR (`|`), which returns a bit set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1; the bitwise XOR (`^`), which returns a bit set to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1; the bitwise NOT (`~`), which inverts all bits of the operand; the left shift (`<<`), which shifts bits to the left and fills with zeros; and the right shift (`>>`), which shifts bits to the right. These operators are used for low-level programming tasks, such as setting, clearing, and toggling specific bits, and for performing fast arithmetic operations. Understanding bitwise operators is essential for tasks that require direct manipulation of data at the bit level, such as system programming, graphics, and encryption.

## Conclusion
Bitwise operators in C++ provide powerful tools for manipulating individual bits of data. They are used in a variety of low-level programming tasks and can greatly optimize certain types of operations. Understanding and implementing these operators is crucial for efficient and effective programming in system-level applications and performance-critical code. This experiment provided an in-depth understanding of how bitwise operators work and their practical applications.
