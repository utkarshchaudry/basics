# Experiment 2

## Aim
To study and implement the structure of a C++ program focusing on data types.

## Theory

### C++ Program Structure
A C++ program typically consists of the following components:
1. **Preprocessor Directives**: Instructions processed before the actual compilation of code begins.
2. **Namespace Declarations**: Allowing the use of standard C++ library names without prefixing them with `std::`.
3. **Main Function**: The entry point of the program where execution begins.
4. **Statements and Expressions**: The body of the program containing variables, operations, and function calls.
5. **Comments**: Non-executable statements used for documentation.

### Data Types in C++
Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. C++ has several built-in data types categorized as follows:

#### Basic Data Types:
1. **Integer Types**:
   - `int`: Represents whole numbers. Size is typically 4 bytes.
   - `short`: Smaller integer type, usually 2 bytes.
   - `long`: Larger integer type, typically 4 or 8 bytes.
   - `long long`: Even larger integer type, usually 8 bytes.
2. **Floating-Point Types**:
   - `float`: Single-precision floating-point. Size is typically 4 bytes.
   - `double`: Double-precision floating-point. Size is typically 8 bytes.
   - `long double`: Extended precision floating-point. Size is usually 8 or 16 bytes.
3. **Character Type**:
   - `char`: Represents a single character. Size is typically 1 byte.
4. **Boolean Type**:
   - `bool`: Represents a boolean value (true or false).

#### Derived Data Types:
1. **Array**: Collection of elements of the same type.
2. **Pointer**: Variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
3. **Reference**: Alias for another variable.
4. **Function**: A block of code that performs a specific task.

#### User-Defined Data Types:
1. **Structure (`struct`)**: Collection of variables of different types.
2. **Class (`class`)**: Collection of variables and functions (methods).
3. **Enumeration (`enum`)**: User-defined type consisting of a set of named values.

## Conclusion
The structure of a C++ program includes preprocessor directives, namespace declarations, the main function, and various statements and expressions. Understanding and implementing different data types is crucial for effective programming in C++. This experiment provided hands-on experience with basic data types in C++ and demonstrated their usage within a simple program.



# Experiment 3

## Aim
To study and implement various operators in C++.

## Theory

### Operators in C++
Operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. C++ provides a rich set of operators classified into several categories:

#### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.
   - **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
   - **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.
   - **Division (`/`)**: Divides the numerator by the denominator.
   - **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of division.

#### 2. **Relational Operators**:
   - **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two operands are equal.
   - **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two operands are not equal.
   - **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than the second.
   - **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the first operand is less than the second.
   - **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
   - **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.

#### 3. **Logical Operators**:
   - **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
   - **Logical OR (`||`)**: Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
   - **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Reverses the logical state of its operand.

#### 4. **Bitwise Operators**:
   - **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Performs a bitwise AND operation.
   - **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Performs a bitwise OR operation.
   - **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
   - **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all the bits of its operand.
   - **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits to the left.
   - **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits to the right.

#### 5. **Assignment Operators**:
   - **Assignment (`=`)**: Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.
   - **Add and assign (`+=`)**: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - **Subtract and assign (`-=`)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - **Multiply and assign (`*=`)**: Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - **Divide and assign (`/=`)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - **Modulus and assign (`%=`)**: Takes the modulus using the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

#### 6. **Increment and Decrement Operators**:
   - **Increment (`++`)**: Increases an integer value by one.
   - **Decrement (`--`)**: Decreases an integer value by one.

#### 7. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**:
   - **Conditional (`?:`)**: Returns one of two values depending on the result of a condition.

### Example Program
The following example demonstrates the use of various operators in a C++ program:

## Conclusion
The experiment covered various operators in C++, including arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, increment/decrement, and the conditional operator. Understanding and correctly implementing these operators is essential for performing different types of operations and controlling the flow of a C++ program. This experiment provided practical knowledge of how these operators work and their applications in a program.
